        <p>Heyo! My name is Joanna Bai! I'm a first year student at Harvard University studying computer science and special education.
        I just got off of a gap year where I worked in a K-2 grade special education classroom.
        I am from Omaha, Nebraska and do indeed believe corn is the most elite side one could choose for a meal.
        My top five favorite artists are Taylor Swift, Kanye West (lmao I know..), Brockhampton, Of Monsters and Men, and One Direction.
        In terms of food, I am a diehard for spaghetti tacos and Sweetgreen.
        </p>

        <p>I believe that Genghis Khan is the greatest emperor the world has ever seen, but standard curriculum is too eurocentric to acknowledge that.
        I would punch Napoleon Bonaparte in the face if I ever had the chance.
        Additionally, I am starting a petition to make 0! be undefined. Mathematicians made 0! equal 1 for the sake of allowing other things (like series) to make sense (don't fact check me on this).
        HOWEVER, it just does not make sense. When we compute a factorial, the calculation ceases at ONE. For example, 5! is 5*4*3*2*1, and we don't multiply by 0 because it would just equal 0.
        Just like we cannot calculate the factorial of a negative number, we should not be able to calculate 0!
        0! makes me so mad; I would love to discuss this further if you care. Which you probably don't... which is understandable.
        </p>

        <p>I own six Build-A-Bear teddy bears, and they have my whole entire heart. Their names are Bentley, Nugget, Avery Rose, Hazel Grace, Chester, and Merlyn Wood.
        I am an absolute God at Wii Bowling and embarassingly awful at catch. At any given moment, you can find me chilling at Barnes and Noble or walking in the park.
        </p>
